    \title Deploying Applications to BlackBerry 10 Devices

    To deploy Qt applications to BlackBerry 10 devices:

    \list 1
        \li Select \gui File > \gui {New File or Project} > \gui {Applications} to create a \gui {Qt Quick Application}, \gui {Qt Widgets Application}, or \gui {BlackBerry Cascades Application}.
        \li Select a BlackBerry 10 \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for either device or simulator. For more information about adding kits, see \l{Connecting BlackBerry 10 Devices}.
        \li When \QC prompts you to generate a bar descriptor file, answer \gui Yes to generate the file and enable the packaging process.
        \li You can use the BAR descriptor editor to customize the appearance and behavior of the application.
    \endlist

    If you have an existing Cascades project created by QNX Momentics IDE, you can import it to \QC:

    \list 1
        \li Select \gui File > \gui {New File or Project} > \gui {Import Project} > \gui {Momentics Cascades Project} > \gui Choose.
        \li Specify an existing Cascades project created by QNX Momentics IDE.
        \li Specify a location for the newly created \QC project.
    \endlist

    A project import report is generated into import.log file located in your project.

    \note \gui {BlackBerry Cascades Application} and \gui {Momentics Cascades Project} projects are available in the \gui {All Templates} filter, so you need to set this filter in the top-right corner of the \gui {New} dialog to enable those templates.

    \note Currently, the BlackBerry 10 devices and Simulator have Qt 4.8 libraries preinstalled. To use Qt 5 features, you must compile the Qt libraries for BlackBerry 10 yourself. For more information, see \l {http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building-Qt5-for-Blackberry}{http://qt-p roject.org/wiki/Building-Qt5-for-Blackberry}.

    For more details please refer to the Qt-Project wiki page: \l {http://qt-project.org/wiki/BlackBerry} {http://qt-project.org/wiki/BlackBerry}.
