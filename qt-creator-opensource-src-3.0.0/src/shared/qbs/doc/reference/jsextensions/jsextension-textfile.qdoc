    \title TextFile Service
    \brief Provides read and write operations on text files.

    The \c TextFile service allows you to read from and write into text files.

    \section1 Making the Service Available
    In order to gain access to text file operations, you need to import the
    service using the
    following statement at the top of your project file:
    \code
    import qbs.TextFile
    \endcode

    \section1 Available operations

    \section2 Constructor
    \code
    TextFile(filePath, openMode)
    \endcode
    Opens the file at \c filePath in the given mode and returns the object representing the file.
    Possible values for \c openMode are \c TextFile.ReadOnly (which is the default),
    \c TextFile.WriteOnly and \c TextFile.ReadWrite. Note that the mode influences which
    of the operations listed below can actually be used on the file.

    \section2 atEof
    \code
    atEof()
    \endcode
    Returns true if no more data can be read from the file, false otherwise.

    \section2 close
    \code
    close()
    \endcode
    Closes the file. We recommended to always call this function as soon as you are finished
    with the file, in order to keep the number of in-flight file descriptors as low as possible.

    \section2 readAll
    \code
    readAll()
    \endcode
    Reads all data from the file and returns it.

    \section2 readLine
    \code
    readLine()
    \endcode
    Reads one line of text from the file and returns it. The returned string does not contain
    the newline characters.

    \section2 setCodec
    \code
    setCodec(codec)
    \endcode
    Sets the text codec to \c codec. The supported codecs are the same as for \c QTextCodec,
    for example: "UTF-8", "UTF-16", and "ISO 8859-1".

    \section2 truncate
    \code
    truncate()
    \endcode
    Truncates the file, that is, gives it the size of zero, removing all content.

    \section2 write
    \code
    write(data)
    \endcode
    Writes \c data into the file at the current position.

    \section2 writeLine
    \code
    writeLine(data)
    \endcode
    Writes \c data into the file at the current position and appends the newline character(s).
