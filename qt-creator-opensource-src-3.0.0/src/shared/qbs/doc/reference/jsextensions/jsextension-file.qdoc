    \title File Service
    \brief Provides operations on the file system.

    The \c File service offers limited access to the file system for operations such as copying
    or removing files.

    \section1 Making the Service Available
    To gain access to file system operations, import the service using the
    following statement at the top of your project file:
    \code
    import qbs.File
    \endcode

    \section1 Available Operations

    \section2 copy
    \code
    File.copy(sourceFilePath, targetFilePath)
    \endcode
    Copies \c sourceFilePath to \c targetFilePath. Any directory components in \c targetFilePath
    that do not yet exist will be created. If \c sourceFilePath is a directory, a recursive
    copy will be made. If an error occurs, a JavaScript exception will be thrown.
    \note \c targetFilePath must be the counterpart of \c sourceFilePath at the new location,
    \b{not} the new parent directory. This allows the copy to have a different name and is true
    even if \c sourceFilePath is a directory.

    \section2 exists
    \code
    File.exists(filePath)
    \endcode
    Returns true if and only if there is a file at \c filePath.

    \section2 remove
    \code
    File.remove(filePath)
    \endcode
    Removes the file at \c filePath. In case of a directory, it will be removed recursively.
